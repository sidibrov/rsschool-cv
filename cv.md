1.  **Summary**:
    My goal is to take RS School community courses and become a front-end programmer. After that, I wish to get a job in an IT company in this specialty.

    I'm interested in learning the Javascript language because javaScript is the only programming language for browsers. It works under Windows, macOS, Linux and on mobile platforms, that is, everywhere. And also Node. js that pushed JavaScript beyond browsers. I also like that a very large community, so frontend training can be very effective.

    Once upon a time I worked as a C programmer - I was engaged in programming controllers such as M51, AWP 7. There is a very small community in this specialization - and it was quite boring to work.

    JavaScript is syntactically similar to the great C language and even supports bit operations, and I like that.
